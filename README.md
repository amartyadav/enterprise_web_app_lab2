# CM4025_NodeOnHeroku

For this lab, the solution is your own GitHub repository with the series of commits that you made to get each step working on Heroku. 
This directory shows my GitHub at the end of the lab. The GitHub with all the commits is [here](https://github.com/PamJohnston/CM4025_NodeOnHeroku/commits/main). You can look through the history and see the changes I made to individual files as I completed each part of the lab. The comments on the commits should indicate various parts of the lab, and may also indicate where I went wrong (usually by not reading the lab sheet properly!) and corrected myself.
